monitor-selections
==================

Monitor X11 selections. The goal is to be like `top` but for the X11 clipboard/PRiMARY selection.

Notes
=====

My C is a bit rusty, so feel free to commment on how I can make it better. As this evolves, I intend to clean it up a bit (and include a real Makefile or something like that).
